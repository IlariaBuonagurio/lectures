## Prerequisites

* docker 1.9+

To install docker on a unix terminal, you can:

```
# Install docker
curl -sSL https://get.docker.com/ | sh
```

For Mac and Windows user the best way to get Docker tools working,
is using their new [toolbox](https://www.docker.com/toolbox).

## How to use lectures interactively

On a terminal:

```
$ docker run -d -p 80:8888 -v spark:/data cineca/nbsparkling
```

### Access the web jupyter notebooks pages

Visit with your browser the jupyter running server at:

[http://localhost](http://localhost).

<small>Note: if you use docker on Mac or Windows, instead of *localhost* you
should find the virtual machine IP where Docker is running.
This is usually possible with commands like `boot2docker ip` or `docker-machine ip`.</small>
